# Exceptions:
  - great thing to master
  - aware of the 'try/except' clause
  - the code which can cause an exception to occure is put in the 'try' block and the
    handling of the exception is implemented in the 'except' block
    ex) 'try-except.py'
    - in the try-except we are handling only the IOError exception. 'We can hadle multiple exceptions'
