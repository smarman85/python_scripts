3.4  Generators:
  - are iterators, but can only iterate over them once.
    because they do not store all the values in memory
    genrate values on the fly. Used in for loops or pass
    them to a function that iterates
  - best for calculatiing large sets of results where you do 
    not want to allocate the memory for all results at the
    same time
