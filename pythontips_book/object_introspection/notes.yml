Object introspection:
  - introspection is the ability to determine the type of object at runtime. 
  - everythong in python is an object

14.1 dir:
  - one of the most important function for introspection. 
  - it returns a list of attributes and methods belogning to an object.
    ex) 'dir.py'
  - our introspection gave us the names of all the methosd of a list. This can be handy when you 
    are not able to recall a method. If we run 'dir()' without any arguments then it returns all names in the 
    current scope

14.2 'type' and 'id':
  - 'type' function returns the type of an object ex) 'type.py'
  - 'id' returns the unique ids of various objects. ex) 'id.py'

14.3 inspect:
  - provides several useful functions to get info about live objects.
    ex) 'inspect.py'  # has error
