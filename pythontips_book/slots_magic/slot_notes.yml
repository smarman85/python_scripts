# Slots:
  Good:
    - by default python uses a dict to store an objects instance attributes
    - helpful as it allows setting arbitrary new attributes at runtime
  Bad:
    - However for small classes with known attributes it might be a bottlenetck
    - dict wastes a lot of RAM
    - python can't allocate a static amount of memory at object creation to store
      all the attributes. Sucks a lot of RAM if you create a lot of objects 
      (like thousands and millions)
    - __slots__ allow you to circumvent this issue
      - slots tell python to not use a dict, and only allocate space for a fixed set of attributes

The two scripts without/with_slots:
  - the one with slots will see a 40 to 50% reduction in RAM usage

Sidenote:
  - give PyPy a try
  - does optimizations by default
